Since Warcraft 3 got [much love recently]({{ page.patch-notes-url }}) I decided
to share some old maps that I've made with a friend back in a day.

First one is a old DotA clone that parodies the local jet set. It has three
lanes, creeps that differ between them, items, towers etc. Be careful because if
you die a random item from your inventory drops so someone can steal it. The map
can be aggravating, but at the same time really fun. Here are some screenshots:

<img src="/public/img/war3/tv4.png" alt="War3 map screenshot" width="90%"/>

The second map is a 'make it to the end of the road alive' challenge map. Pick
one out of 6 custom heroes and start the journey. You need to kill every enemy on
the map and stay alive to win. Watch out for hidden enemies. Here are the
screenshots of this map:

<img src="/public/img/war3/fu3.png" alt="War3 map screenshot" width="90%"/>
<img src="/public/img/war3/fu4.png" alt="War3 map screenshot" width="90%"/>

You can download them [here]({{ page.zip-link }}).

These maps were made for fun and are arguably not that high quality, but if you
look for some serious projects you can find them over at the [Hive]({{ page.hive-url }}).

Enjoy!
