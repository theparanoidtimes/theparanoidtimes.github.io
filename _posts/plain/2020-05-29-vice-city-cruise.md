For me Grand Theft Auto Vice City is the best-made game in the whole
franchise and the one game I return to regularly. Often I just drive
around a bit and listen to the amazing radio soundtrack the game has
just to relax.

So I decided to create a series of videos of Tommy Vercetti cruising
around Vice City listening to all the (music) radio stations. The 
videos will serve as a 'quick fix' for all Vice City junkies out there.

The YouTube playlist is [here]({{ page.playlist-url }}). There are two
bonus videos on it also.

Enjoy.
