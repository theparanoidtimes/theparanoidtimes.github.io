There is a new protocol that is gaining traction on the Web - [Gemini]({{ page.gemini-url }}).
It's a minimalist text-based protocol that is reminiscent of the Web
of the past. The ecosystem, called Geminispace, is growing larger
by the day and it already has a tone of interesting stuff. I encourage
you to explore.

I have made a presence there with my own capsule - [gemini://capsule.theparanoidtimes.org]({{ page.capsule-url }}).

More info about the capsule itself is [here]({{ page.capsule-project-url }}).

Enjoy!
