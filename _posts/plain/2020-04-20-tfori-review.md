_The friends of Ringo Ishikawa_ is a game, an experience I didn't know
I needed. When you start the game you really don't know what are you
getting into yet. The game really takes its sweet time to tell you about
itself. Or should I say you can take your sweet time to find out what
is this game about.

The game starts with you controlling the protagonist Ringo who is
immediately caught up in a fight with a rival gang alongside his
friend Ken. From the start the game evokes the feeling of old fighting
games with its minimalistic controls - only three buttons plus the
movement keys. You fight in train then in a train station and later
in the streets of Ringo's (unnamed) hometown. At this point you are
certain that this is a fighting game until the game progresses to
a time year later than the introduction scenario.

Set in Ringo's school, filled with adrenaline from the previous fights you
wait for more, only to be 'welcomed' by a school principal, a casual
smoke with a friend (Masaru) and a whole town to explore. You are
not required to participate in any fighting while exploring the town.
After a while it felt like a complete opposite to a fighting game.
I've spent a couple of (game) days roaming around waiting for the 
game to guide me. I was waiting for a quest-like mechanic. When enough
time passed it suddenly hit me! This game is a real life simulation
and I can do what ever I want! At this point all the wonders of this
game have shown up.

I'm Ringo, my group's captain in my town doing what I want with my
life. I read, I smoke, I eat (a lot), I get in occasional fight if I
want etc. The freedom to do stuff while gently being guided by the game
into the story direction is one of the biggest pluses of
this game. Along side, a beautiful pixel art design of the city
that will appeal to anyone with the slightest interest in Japan
aesthetics. The whole adventure is accompanied by a great music
soundtrack that I'm already looking to buy. The game itself ran
fine for me. There were some graphic bugs like a pedestrian spawning
in the sky rather on the street, but overall everything worked well.
Controls are, as mentioned, minimalistic but present no problem in
controlling the character (jumping/workout can be a bit unpredictable).
My personal favorite is a button dedicated to lighting a cigarette.
One could say a perfect waste of a control bind, but I say we don't
have enough such features in modern games. Plus, lighting a cigarette - 
an essential thing for a gang captain.

On the other hand, no game is perfect and neither is this one. The
main flaw, for me, was completely related to the storytelling.
The ending felt rushed and there are a lot of loose story
threads we never get to finish. The gentle guidance, now pushes you
of the cliff directly to the game end. And by the time I got to the end
I was really emotionally invested in the characters and the story
that I was heartbroken when the game ended. I wanted to know all:
what happened after the double date, what happened with Goro and Ken,
with Masaru and Murakawa etc. The really liked the story and it has
a great potential, but it was poorly realized at the end.

That being said, I still encourage people to buy and play this game.
If you like being guided by the game all throughout or feel like you
are going to be aggravated by the ending this game is not for you. 
For me the experience, in whatever way realized, is worth the money.
_TFORI_ is a mould breaking game, a welcome novelty in the game world
and certainly a manifest of the genre I will closely follow in
the future.
