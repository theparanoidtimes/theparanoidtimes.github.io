Hi, I am Dejan Josifović (Дејан Јосифовић, IPA: dejan josifoʋitɕ) a software
craftsman situated in Belgrade, Serbia and this is my part blog, part
portfolio site. I mostly program in Java and Clojure, but I have many other
interests (like IoT, games, music etc.) and will put an effort to touch every one
of them here. Another way to put it is that this is my part serious, part not so
serious site. Let me explain.

The serious part will encompass my projects and open source contributions.
All my work is located on my personal GitHub profile and on '_the paranoid times_'
GitHub organization page. There are a lot of projects, commercial, open source
contribution, learning a new language or tool or just fun ones. No matter
the subject I take each project seriously and any one of them can be presented
on this site. You can view the list of my projects [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).

The not so serious part of the site will be my [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog).
The first non-serious thing is that there is no schedule for posting, I will
post when I have something to say intersected with when I have the time to
write it. The second, well, not so not serious thing is that there is no some
kind of overall theme for the blog. I will write about everything and anything
I feel about writing, being that programming, IoT, games, music, food, etc, so
stay tuned.

If you like the site check out the [source]({{ site.github.repo }}). It is written
with [Jekyll]({{ page.jekyll-url }}) and the theme is the modification of
[BlackDoc]({{ page.black-doc-url }}) theme.

Enjoy!
