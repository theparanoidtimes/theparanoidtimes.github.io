When you do a lot of file manipulation either on production or in development it
is always helpful to have most commonly used functions stored somewhere so they
can be used when needed. That is exactly what `filer` represents - a library of
various file manipulation function that strive to be highly reusable.

Currently `filer` recognizes four groups of functions: functions for directory
processing - `org.theparanoidtimes.filer.directory-processor` namespace,
for raw/text file processing - `org.theparanoidtimes.filer.raw-file-processor`,
for XML file processing - `org.theparanoidtimes.filer.xml-processor` and for
HTML file processing - `org.theparanoidtimes.html.html-processor` namespace.

This library is very much work in progress so it looks a bit rough on the edges.
The initial idea was to have a collection of HTML parsing and assertion
functions, but irronicaly that part is the least done. When `filer` reaches
a sufficient competition level I will explain the usage in detail. For now you
can check out the [repo]({{ page.project-repo }}) for more info.
