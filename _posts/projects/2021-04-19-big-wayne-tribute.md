Big Wayne was a part of the cast of _The Lazlow show_, the (terrestrial,
and later internet) radio show that was active between 2005. and 2014. 
The show was about anything and everything, classified as a talk show.
Major part of air time was dedicated to talking about Big Wayne and his
life as a teenager in Queens with some episodes from his, than, current
life spent in Long Beach. He was a - colorful - character to say the least
and as such, a pleasant voice on the radio to many.

Unfortunately he passed away in 2014. which also brought an end to The
Lazlow show.

I have made a little tribute to him in a form of a list/map of his
most memorable moments in life (that he shared with the public of course).
See it [here]({{ page.site-url }}).

I seems that Lazlow show is not available for download anymore. Lazlow
still has his [site]({{ page.lazlow-url }}) up, if you feel like listening
to hours of quality radio (as in you'll laugh your face off) you can ask
him about it there.
