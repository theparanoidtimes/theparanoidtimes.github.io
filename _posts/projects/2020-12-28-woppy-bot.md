While listening to the [Cox 'n' Crendor]({{ page.cnc-url }}) show I thought
that creating a Woppy Bot would be a nice research/relax project. The
idea is to have an app that will tell the basic weather info for a
random place in the US with the push of a button. The result must have
the zip code of the picked place alongside the name, state, and weather
info of course.

There were two major decisions to make: how/where to access the zip
codes database and how to retrieve weather data. For the database,
I choose to make a CSV file with the info that I needed: zip code, place
name, state name, and state abbreviation. A couple of Google searches
later I found a [Web site]({{ page.geonames-url }}) that has various
data sets regarding place names, postal codes, etc. The one
[data set]({{ page.dataset-url }}) I choose had more info than I needed
so I had to reduce it<sup id="f1r">[1](#f1)</sup>.

With the data set secured all I had to do is find any weather API that
can provide data given the zip code of a place. Sounds simple. Wrong!
There is only one normal API out there that accepts zip code as a
primary identifier of a place and it's
[OpenWeatherMap]({{ page.openweatherapi-url }})<sup id="f2r">[2](#f2)</sup>.
OWM exposes a URL that accepts zip code and returns the current weather data
for the place behind it. It also has a little icon (URL) depicting the
current weather in the response.

The technology of the choice was Node for the back-end and vanilla JS for the front.
Node server's responsibility is to pick a city using a random number generator
and communicate to the OpenWeatherMap API. It exposes one endpoint for the front
to retrieve data. The server is hosted on Heroku using the free dyno program. This
is very convenient since I needed a way to simulate starting the Woppy bot
which is covered by free dyno's startup time (since it goes to sleep after
some idle time).

Front-end is a plain JS/jQuery site that calls the Node back-end for weather
and place info. One other requirement was that zip code digits are displayed
one by one as if they were spoken out loud. This is handled by using intervals.
