In this day and age where security on the Internet is very much at the center of
attention along with user privacy it is very important that online stores and
services do as best as they can to ensure these things to the users. One way for us,
the end users, to provide motivation, is to shame all Web sites that have in
any way jeopardized our existence on the Web! :-)

One such project is *dumb-password-rules*, that focuses on shaming Web sites that
have dumb rules when creating a password for an account or similar. You can
check it out [here]({{ page.dpr-repo }}).

I have made a couple of contributions to the cause:
* _[Updated 09.02.2021]_ Raiffeisen Bank Serbia;
* MLB.com;
* Banca Intesa Serbia;
* _[Added 10.02.2021] Vip mobile Serbia._

Check out the fork [here]({{ page.project-repo }}).

A plea to the reader, don't stop here. Do everything that is in your power to
raise awareness about security on the Internet. Write a blog, tweet it out,
contribute to this project or start your own, anything that will spread the good
word. Security is already a hard thing why make it harder...
