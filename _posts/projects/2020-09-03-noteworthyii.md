One of my favorite game genres is RPG and that  means that I
play them a lot. Games of this type can tend to become... overwhelming
at times. With a lot of different goals presented to the player like
complete quests, after those quests complete another set of quests,
explore here, get this achievement, etc. it can sometimes become hard
to track the progress and keep up with the plan. That is why I always
keep notes while playing RPGs. But a lot of the games don't have
that mechanic built into them.

One such game is World of Warcraft, another one of my favorites. This
game has a very powerful add-on framework, so I decided to create a
notebook-style add-on. Since I didn't make any type of WoW add-on
before I first started looking for a similar add-on project to serve as a
reference point. Fortunately, I found an abandoned notebook add-on
called [Noteworthy]({{ page.original-noteworthy-url }}). After some
thinking, and approval from the original author, I decided to
continue the development of this project.

The first task was to make the add-on work with the retail version of
the game. Even if it was abandoned a long time ago, the code upgrade
didn't take much time meaning that I had a solid code base to start
with. I was confident enough to fully dedicate to the project.

The first decision was to rebrand to Noteworthy II making essentially
a new project based on the older incarnation. That way the original
work can remain intact and I will have complete artistic freedom
over the new one.

At the time of writing, Noteworthy II version 2.0 is released to
[CurseForge]({{ page.curse-forge-url }}) and has over 150 downloads.
Version 2.0 only contains cosmetic improvements over the original
version, but it lays a foundation for the project itself. Now I will
focus on introducing new functionalities, the major one in the works
being the undo feature.

The main development repo is [here]({{ page.repo-url }}).

Many thanks to the original author GhostDancer74.

Enjoy writing notes using Noteworthy II.
