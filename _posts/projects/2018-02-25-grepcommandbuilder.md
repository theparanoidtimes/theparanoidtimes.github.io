One cannot always remember all the possibilities of the `grep` command if it
is not used daily.*grep command builder* provides the declarative GUI
alternative to browsing the `man`.

*grep command builder* is a Web application that allows you to specify what do
you want to do with `grep` and then generates the command string for you. There
is a fixed number of `grep` options to choose, some of the most common ones,
but new ones will be added in the future.

Check it out [here]({{ page.project-url }}).

This is a ClojureScript with Reagent application, if you want to check out the
code, see the GitHub [repo]({{ page.project-repo }}).
